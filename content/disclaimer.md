Disclaimer
==========

I speak _only_ for myself and not my [current](//www.linkedin.com),
[past](//www.google.com), future or any other employers you or I have imagined I
work for. On occasion, I get away with speaking for my wife (although she
dislikes it).

If you quote anything I say as "[anyone other than Val Markovic] said" I will be
very disappointed in you. Not cool. Don't do that (_please_).

If at some point I _do_ end up speaking for someone else on this site, rest
assured you will be notified by flamingos the color of _lapis lazuli_
falling from the sky. It will be excruciatingly hard to miss, so don't worry.

I work for LinkedIn, an absolutely amazing company. No matter how hard I try,
this _probably_ biases my viewpoints in some unquantifiable way, at least on a
subconscious level. Keep that in mind.

No, I still don't speak for them.

I reserve the right to not have a clue. Be forewarned, I exercise it frequently.
