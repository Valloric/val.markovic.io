title: Recommended Books on Modern Investing and Personal Finance
summary: "A list of books for optimizing one's financial success and happiness
that everyone should read."

We should all know more about prudent investing. You're saving for retirement,
right? If you are (and if you aren't, you should be), then you're investing in
something. You're not just letting that money sit in a checking/savings account.
Here are some books you should read to optimize your financial success and
happiness.

_[TL;DR: For the impatient crowd, go read [The Four Pillars of
Investing][pillars] right now. For the super-impatient, here's a grossly
inadequate four-word summary of modern personal investment advice: low-cost
index funds. Don't have a clue what I'm talking about? Read on.]_

I've been fascinated with Financial Mathematics ever since I took a (gruelingly
difficult) class in it in graduate school. Since then, I've read a few more
books on the topic. It remains the only field of Mathematics other than Discreet
Math that truly interests me.[^interest] But these are merely hobbies; I hold no
delusions of grandeur in my abilities in these areas.

[^interest]: By "interest", I mean "I could conceivably see myself doing this
for a living." Not that I have any intention to, of course; I love Software
Engineering far more.

Knowledge of Financial Mathematics prepares one for investing in much the
same way that Computer Science prepares one for Software Engineering. In other
words, not at all. There are many, many reasons why investing is an altogether
different beast. Those of you who have read more than one Financial Math
university textbook, quick, how many references did those books make to taxes
and investment costs?[^cs]

[^cs]: If you have a CS background, compare this with the number of references to
version control systems, software testing, code style guidelines and code
readability (among other things) in all of the CS books you have read.

So FM textbooks are naturally out. There's a ridiculous number of investment
books out there, most of which are less than stellar. Some of the good ones are
also out of date, and a lot of them are tailored to institutional investors.
I've picked out a nice selection of sage advice for the personal investor in the
following list; I've read all of the listed books and quite a few I'm not
listing. None of the books I'm recommending should be controversial and I'm not
affiliated with any of them; there are no referral links here and I have no skin
in this game.

The Basics
----------

These are must-read books. I'm presenting them in a sensible reading order that
will slowly teach you more and more, building on what you have previously read:

*   [_The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need_][guide] by Andrew Tobias: Yes,
    I know, the title is terrible (and patently false). To the author's credit,
    he apologizes for it in the preface and says it was the publisher's idea.
    But no matter; it's a really good book.

    It covers a _very_ wide area and spends a considerable amount of time on
    Personal Finance. If you're young and just out of college (or soon to be),
    this is where you should start. If you think you have a firm grasp of
    Personal Finance, then you should _definitely_ start here. This book also
    describes in detail many different investment vehicles (with pros & cons of
    each); it also covers planning for retirement, differences between the
    various retirement accounts (401k/Roth 401k/IRA/Roth IRA), annuities,
    insurance, tax laws, estate planning, ESA's, 529s, SEP's, SIMPLE's and the
    kitchen sink, too. Seriously, start here.

    The book is also well written and remarkably funny. You will enjoy reading
    it.

    Make sure you get the latest edition of the book. It's been out for nearly
    thirty years now, but the author updates it every three or four years as the
    tax and investment landscape changes. The latest editions have little in
    common with the earlier ones.

*   [_The Four Pillars of Investing_][pillars] by William Bernstein: This is a
    brilliant book and the one I recommend the most out of this bunch. It does
    require the reader to be comfortable with math to a minute extent.

    It will teach you how to think about investment returns and it will provide
    a brief history of investment folly. It will provide mountains of data on
    how (and why) actively managed funds fail to beat low-cost index funds and
    why individual stock-picking is a loser's game. It will teach you how to
    tailor an investment portfolio that matches your financial situation (and
    personal risk disposition) and why you should avoid investment banks,
    brokers and preferably the entire investment industry, lest it eat up
    considerable portions of your returns.

    If you come away from this blog post with one book in mind, _let it be this
    one_. It's the best and the most important one I can think of.

    I _cannot_ recommend this book highly enough. Instead of peddling vague and
    anecdotal advice based on some random guy's experience (which is what most
    investment books do), Bernstein approaches personal investing as a science.
    He backs up everything he says with sound data and references to modern
    investment research. All of his advice is practical and actionable. _Read
    this now_.

*   [_A Random Walk Down Wall Street_][walk] by Burton Malkiel: This book will
    teach you how to "think" about the market. It will cover pretty much all the
    stock market bubbles throughout history and what caused them. This will help
    you recognize similar craziness in the future. It's also chock-full of more
    proof on why actively managed funds underperform index funds and why
    stock-picking is something only monkeys with darts do. It will teach you
    about the Efficient Market Hypothesis and why it still makes sense after all
    these years (well, the semi-strong variety at least... and it makes sense
    _the vast majority_ of the time, except when it doesn't, for reasons that I
    will not go into right now).  This book is absolutely worth your time.

After reading the _Guide_, the _Pillars_ and the _Walk_, you can confidently
stop. This is my three-book list for investment newcomers. After completing
this book bundle you'll know more about investing than most "professional" money
managers. If you implement the advice in these books, your returns will also beat
the returns of ~80% of actively managed funds, _over the long term_
(20+ years).[^returns]

[^returns]: We're talking _real_ returns here, not _nominal_ returns (you "eat"
real returns). Also, after-tax (again, you don't "eat" pre-tax money). In other
words, we're talking about money _you end up caring about_.

If you can read only two, go with the _Guide_ and the _Pillars_. If just one,
then the _Pillars_. But preferably all of them. That's it, you can stop reading
this blog post if you wish.

Greater Appetite
----------------

If you want to know even more about sound investing, here are some other books
I'd recommend:

*   [_The Intelligent Asset Allocator_][asset-alloc] by William Bernstein: This
    was Bernstein's first book. It's very good, but _Pillars_ covers everything
    that _Allocator_ does and much more. This book goes into more detail about
    asset allocation, but frankly _Pillars_ gives you all of the really meaty
    parts.  _Allocator_ will go into more data, graphs, proof and math on why
    the things Bernstein recommends in _Pillars_ make sense. A worthwhile read,
    certainly, but if you've read his second tome you're not going to get that
    much from it. Read it if you want some extra in-depth data on asset class
    behavior, otherwise skip it.

    Some people will tell you that understanding this book requires knowledge of
    advanced mathematics. Nonsense. It's certainly more math-heavy than
    _Pillars_, but if knowledge to understand it passes for "advanced math",
    someone please shoot me now.

*   [_Common Sense on Mutual Funds_][common-sense] by John C. Bogle: Mountains
    upon mountains of data on why index funds beat active funds in the long
    term. Truly, _mountains_. The biggest complaint is that the book is
    extremely repetitive; the same message is repeated over and over again. And
    then some more. And did you know that index funds beat active funds? They
    do. You didn't know that? Fine, here's evidence item #892374984.

    After a time, it tends to grate a bit. But convince you of its message it
    will.

    Also, Bogle famously shares some disdain for foreign market diversification.
    He's an absolute giant of finance and this is his only major flaw. The book
    is still a worthwhile read.

*   [_The Intelligent Investor_][int-invest] by Benjamin Graham: This is Warren
    Buffett's mentor. If you want to know more about the stock market and what
    makes certain companies better stocks than others, read this. But keep in
    mind that you _shouldn't be buying individual stocks at all_. Index funds
    were invented after Graham died; had they been around when he was, he would
    have probably been all over them. But this book will broaden your horizons
    if you read it, so it's not a bad read, even if you don't end up using the
    knowledge in it.[^lisp]

[^lisp]: It's a lot like reading _Structure and Interpretation of Computer
Programs_ for programmers who will never write a line of Scheme in their
professional life. Still worthwhile, gives you depths of understanding. This is
the SICP of investing.

Uncommonly Recommended
----------------------

Here are some other good books on investing I __don't__ usually recommend (they
make sense, but the alternatives are better and cover the same areas):

*   [_The Investor's Manifesto_][manifesto] by William Bernstein: This book is a
    dumbed-down version of _Pillars_. If you've read that book, ignore this one.
    It offers virtually nothing new, merely a rehashing of Bernstein's old
    (still perfectly valid) advice without the data backing it up.  Read this
    book if you're scared of graphs, charts and tables. I recommend it only to
    people who can't handle _Pillars_ because they're frightened of the most
    basic high-school level math.

*   [_The Bogleheads' Guide to Investing_][bogleheads] by Taylor Larimore, Mel
    Lindauer and Michael LeBoeuf: This is a pretty good all-around book on
    investing and retirement planning, but _Pillars_ + _Guide_ is a better
    option. There's no bad advice here.

Investing and Finance, Broadly
------------------------------

And now that we've reached the end, here are some books that may not teach you
much about investing, but will teach you plenty about the specific areas of
finance that they cover:

*   [_Liar's Poker_][poker] by Michael Lewis: If you ever wanted to know why
    brokers and investment banks are the biggest enemies of their customers,
    read this book.  It chronicles Lewis's life as a broker for Salomon Brothers
    in the '80s. It's not pretty (but it is a fun read). Little has changed
    since then; the finance industry may have become just a shade[^shade] more
    unethical. Keep in mind, the book starts out a bit slow.

[^shade]: Did I say "just a shade"? I meant "you couldn't possibly imagine how
much more." See _The Big Short_.

*   [_The Big Short_][short] by Michael Lewis: Another great book from Lewis,
    this time about how and why the 2007 recession started. You get to learn
    just how bat-shit crazy with greed Wall Street can become. If you ever
    wanted to know "the real deal" behind the Great Recession, read this. It's a
    peculiar mix of laugh-out-loud funny and blow-your-brains-out depressing.

*   [_When Genius Failed_][genius] by Roger Lowenstein: Covers the fall of the
    Long Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998. You may have heard of this
    event, it damn-nigh brought the financial industry to its knees (much like
    the recent recession in fact did). The fund had derivative positions with a
    notional value of ~$1.25 _trillion_, and had to be bailed out by the Fed of
    New York.  Does this perhaps sound familiar? We never learn.

*   [_Buffett: The Making of an American Capitalist_][buffett] by Roger
    Lowenstein: A biography covering Warren Buffett. Very well written. It's an
    entertaining read with sensible investment advice sprinkled throughout.
